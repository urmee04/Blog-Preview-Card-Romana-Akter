## Lab 3.2: Practicing Implementation with Frontend Mentor

### Second Challenge â€“ Blog Preview Card

This project is a solution to the [Frontend Mentor - Blog Preview Card Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS) which focuses on practicing HTML & CSS skills by recreating a responsive and interactive blog preview card component based on a Figma design.

#### Objectives

- Recreate the blog preview card layout based on the Figma design.
- Implement accurate layout, typography, spacing, and colors.
- Add interactive hover and focus states.
- Ensure responsiveness for mobile (375px) and desktop (1440px).

#### Features

- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop.
- Semantic HTML structure using `<article>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.
- Hover effect on the card and card title with smooth transitions.
- Focus accessibility on interactive elements using `:focus` styles.
- CSS custom properties (`:root`) for easy color management.

#### Technologies Used

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 (Custom Properties, Flexbox, Media Queries)
- Google Fonts (Figtree: weights 500, 800)

#### How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP.
2. Make sure the folder structure is preserved (`assets/images/`).
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the card.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blog-preview-card.git
cd blog-preview-card
open index.html

##### Reflections

1. How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?

- Using Figma designs gave me a clear visual reference, which helped me plan layout, spacing, and typography more accurately. It made the coding process more structured and focused.

2. What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?
 
 - Matching exact spacing and font sizes was challenging, especially across different screen sizes. It also took effort to implement precise hover and focus states.

3. How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?

- Feedback and community solutions can show different approaches to solving the same problem, helping me learn best practices, improve my code quality, and grow through peer learning.
